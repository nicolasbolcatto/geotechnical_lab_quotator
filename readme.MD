# Geotechnical Laboratory Quotator

# Project description

This is my first project using JavaScript. It's a web app used to select geotechnical laboratory tests and calculate the total price (works as a shopping cart). Selected items list and prices can be exported to PDF.

The main goal of the project is to create my first website to complete the JavaScript course at [Coderhouse](https://www.coderhouse.com/).

# Tech Stack

The following languages, platforms, features and technologies are included in the project so far:

- Bootstrap 5
- SCSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Sweet Alert
- Toastify
- jsPDF

# Functionality

The web app works as a shopping cart, allowing the user to obtain a quotation for the selected tests and print it in PDF format. The search bar allows to dinamically filter items based on their name, and filtering can also be made with categories.
