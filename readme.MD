# Geotechnical Laboratory Quotation App

Work in progress...

# Project description

This is my first project using JavaScript. It's a web app used to select geotechnical laboratory tests and calculate the total price (works as a shopping cart).

The main goal of the project is to create my first website to complete the JavaScript course at [Coderhouse](https://www.coderhouse.com/).

# Tech Stack

The following languages, platforms, features and technologies are included in the project so far:

- Responsive Design
- Git and GitHub for version control
- Bootstrap 5
- SCSS
- JavaScript (Conditionals, Loops, DOM manipulation, Events, Promises)
- Sweet Alert

Still to add:

- Animations and transitions using CSS and AOS (https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)
- jQuery
- AJAX & Fetch

# Functionality

The web app works as a shopping cart. It also allows the user to add personalized items and obtain a quotation for the selected tests.

Future possible improvements are:

- Give functionality to the search bar
- Automatic calculation of prices based on price indexes and dates.
- PDF or Excel output of the item list, item prices and total price.
- And more to come
