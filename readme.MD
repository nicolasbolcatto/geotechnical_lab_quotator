# geotechnical laboratory quotation app

Work in progress...

# Project description

This is my first project using JavaScript. It's a web app used to select geotechnical laboratory tests and calculate the total price (works as a shopping cart).

The main goal of the project is to create my first website to complete the JavaScript course at [Coderhouse](https://www.coderhouse.com/).

# Tech Stack

The following languages, platforms, features and technologies are included in the project so far:

- Responsive Design
- Git and GitHub for version control
- Bootstrap 5
- SCSS
- JavaScript (Conditionals, Loops, DOM manipulation, Events)

Still to add:

- Animations and transitions using CSS and AOS (https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)
- JavaScript libraries like Sweet Alert
- jQuery
- AJAX & Fetch

# Functionality

The web app works as a shopping cart. It also allows the user to add personalized items.

So far, some refactoring is needed in order to allow correct functionality in terms of adding and deleting items.

Future possible improvements are:

- Add pictures of each test. 
- Automatic calculation of prices based on price indexes and dates.
- PDF output of the item list, item prices and total price.
- And more to come
